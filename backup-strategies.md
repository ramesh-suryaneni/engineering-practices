# Data Backup Strategies

## 3-2-1 Method

A foundational backup strategy consisting of:

- **3** copies of data (primary/original + 2 separate backups)
- **2** different types of storage (local server/hard drive + cloud service)
- **1** copy offsite (backup stored in separate physical or cloud location)

## 3-2-1-1-0 Method (Modern)

An enhanced backup strategy developed as a response to modern threats like ransomware:

- **1** (additional) One backup copy stored offline (not connected to any network) or immutable (cannot be altered/deleted)
- **0** (additional) Zero errors (regularly test backups to ensure they can be restored without any errors)
