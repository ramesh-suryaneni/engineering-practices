# **System Design**

80% of System Design Interviews are based on 20% of the problems.

Here is what you need to master.

**1\. Scalable Data Storage**

• Relational vs. NoSQL: Know when to use SQL vs. NoSQL databases.  
• Partitioning: Vertical and horizontal partitioning (sharding). Understand trade-offs.  
• Indexing: Covering indexes, primary vs. secondary indexes.  
• Consistency Models: Strong, eventual, causal.

**2\. Caching**

• Client-side vs. Server-side Cache: Understand where caching should happen.  
• Caching Strategies: Write-through, write-back, write-around.  
• Distributed Cache: Redis, Memcached.   
• Cache Eviction Policies: LRU, LFU, etc.

**3\. Load Balancing**

• Horizontal Scaling: Why and how to horizontally scale services.  
• Load Balancing Techniques:  
• Round-robin, consistent hashing.  
• Reverse Proxy: Understand how to use Nginx, HAProxy.

**4\. Asynchronous Processing**

• Message Brokers: Kafka, RabbitMQ. When to use queues vs. streams.  
• Event-Driven Architecture: Benefits of decoupling and event sourcing.  
• Task Queues: For delayed jobs or retries.

**5\. Database Read and Write Scaling**

• Read Scaling: Master  
• replication, read replicas.  
• Write Scaling: Challenges with partitioning for writes, leader-election.  
• CAP Theorem: Consistency, Availability, or Partition tolerance may be compromised.

**6\. Distributed Systems Concepts**

• Consensus Algorithms: Paxos, Raft.  
• Conflict Resolution: Last Write Wins, CRDTs, vector clocks for data reconciliation.

**7\. Reliability and Failover**
Redundancy: Active-passive vs. active-active configurations.  
• Health Checks.  
• Retries and Circuit Breakers: How to protect systems from cascading failures.

**8\. CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)**

• Static Content Delivery: Why use a CDN, how does it work?  
• Caching at the Edge: How CDNs improve latency for end users.

**9\. API Design and Rate Management**

• REST vs. GraphQL: Difference and practical use-cases for each.  
• Pagination and Filtering: Strategies for efficiently fetching data.  
• API Versioning: Best practices for evolving APIs.  
• Throttle Requests: Why rate limiting is essential, algorithms like token bucket, leaky bucket.

**10\. Search Systems**

• Indexing: Building and maintaining indexes for fast search.  
• Full-Text Search Engines: ElasticSearch, Azure AI Search.  
• Ranking and Relevance: Basic understanding of how scoring works.

**11\. Monitoring, Observability and Security**

• Metrics Collection: Prometheus, Grafana.  
• Distributed Tracing: OpenTelemetry, Sentry.  
• Centralized Logging.  
• Authentication and  
• Authorization: OAuth, JWT.  
• Encryption: Data in transit vs. data at rest.
